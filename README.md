### Introduction
This is a minimalist plugin with exactly one function: cooldown any reconnections. Nothing fancy or complicated is involved. It only does the simplest task you ask for, and hence the performance. <p>

This plugin is especially useful if you have installed some heavy plugins that do a lot of loadings on join events. Frequent reconnection not only floods the chat with join messages, it might also cause troubles to some plugins. This plugin aims at providing a solution to this issue by introducing a cooldown on reconnections. <br>
